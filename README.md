# Match

Match is a social media application for athletes that my team and I were developing as a hobby. Match was a finalist in the SUTD What-The-Hack 2022 Hacakathon and was considered as one of the most well-developed applications during the hackathon. As the team lead, I was reponsible with idea generation as well as team management/delegation. Aside from my role as tech-lead, I was the cloud engineer for the application as well. My responsibilities as a cloud engineer included but not limited to; database management, API engineering and deployment.
